# FSWD Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

## Goal of the Project
Develop a single page application featuring the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) of your neighborhood. The responsive web page will have highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. This example shows [Lidl stores in Luxembourg](https://www.lidl.lu/fr/index.htm).

## Design Patterns
This project uses [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), a JavaScript MVVM library to keep our codebase manageable.

## APIs
We are using the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and getting weather information from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/). Please generate your personal API keys.

## Official Style Guide
This code adheres to the [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/).
